# ernst_angle

Ernst Angle Calculator written in the flutter framework (intended for Android, apk included in the release).  

The Ernst angle is the flip angle achieving the best "SNR per time unit" for a specific T1 and TR value.  

This app is dedicated to all those time when the wifi fails to connect (because the MRI console is in a basement and shielded) and you still need to compute the flip angle.
